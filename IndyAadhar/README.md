A New Aadhar System that provides Self-sovereign identity (SSI) rooted on blockchains and are interoperable with other Blockchains and Organizations.

###Disadvantages of the current Aadhar System
* Centralized Storage of Personal and Biometric Data of 1.2 Billion Citizens of India.

IndyAadhar provides a solution for all of the above problems as it is distributed storage based and gives the control of User's data completely to the User.
